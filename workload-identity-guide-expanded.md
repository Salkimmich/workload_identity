# Beyond Secrets: Workload Identity and Secure Compute in 2025

Workload identity has evolved from the early days of mutual authentication protocols to today’s cutting-edge technologies like SPIFFE, SPIRE, and Confidential Computing. In this post, we will walk through the complete landscape: from how trusted workload identities work to how you can implement them in practice — across Kubernetes, AWS, Envoy, and confidential enclaves.

This guide assumes some familiarity with application security and cloud infrastructure but aims to be accessible. Whether you’re a platform engineer, an application security lead, or a curious builder, you’ll leave with the tools to start securely authenticating your workloads.
