# Complete Guide to Workload Identity: From SPIFFE and SPIRE to Confidential Computing

This comprehensive guide walks you through everything you need to understand, implement, and extend secure workload identity in cloud-native environments. It includes historical background, conceptual overviews, practical walkthroughs, real code snippets, and configuration files spanning Kubernetes, AWS IAM, OIDC, SPIFFE/SPIRE, and Confidential Computing platforms like Intel SGX and AWS Nitro.

## 5. JWT-SVID Federation and AWS Integration

[Corrected AWS Trust Policy JSON]
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/spire-oidc.example.org"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "spire-oidc.example.org:sub": "spiffe://example.org/payments-service"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

[Complete SPIRE JWT Issuer Configuration HCL]
```hcl
server {
  bind_address = "0.0.0.0"
  bind_port = "8081"
  trust_domain = "example.org"
  data_dir = "/opt/spire/data/server"
  log_level = "DEBUG"
  public_url = "https://spire-oidc.example.org"
}

# Node Attestor and DataStore config omitted for brevity...

jwt_issuer "aws" {
  issuer = "https://spire-oidc.example.org"
  key_file = "/run/spire/jwt-key.pem"
  audience = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
  ttl = "5m"
}

endpoints {
  oidc_discovery {
    enabled = true
    issuer = "https://spire-oidc.example.org"
    cors_origins = ["*"]
  }
}
```
