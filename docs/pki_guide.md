## Basic PKI Concepts

### What is PKI?
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that manages digital certificates and public key encryption. It enables secure communication and identity verification in distributed systems.

### Core Components

1. **Digital Certificates**
   - Electronic documents that bind public keys to identities
   - Contain information about the certificate holder
   - Signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)

2. **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**
   - Trusted entities that issue and verify certificates
   - Maintain certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
   - Establish trust chains

3. **Public/Private Key Pairs**
   - Public keys: Shared publicly for encryption and verification
   - Private keys: Kept secure for decryption and signing
   - Used for:
     - Secure communication (encryption)
     - Digital signatures
     - Identity verification

### Common Use Cases
- Secure communication (TLS/SSL)
- Digital signatures
- Code signing
- Email encryption
- Identity verification

## Certificate Lifecycle Management

### 1. Certificate Issuance
- Request generation
- Identity verification
- Certificate signing
- Distribution

### 2. Certificate Validation
- Chain of trust verification
- Revocation checking
- Expiration monitoring
- Usage validation

### 3. Certificate Renewal
- Automated renewal processes
- Grace period management
- Key rotation
- Chain updates

### 4. Certificate Revocation
- Revocation reasons
- CRL management
- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
- Emergency revocation procedures

## Key Management Best Practices

### 1. Key Generation
- Use strong random number generators
- Appropriate key sizes
- Secure generation environment
- Key pair uniqueness

### 2. Key Storage
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- Secure key vaults
- Access control
- Encryption at rest

### 3. Key Rotation
- Regular rotation schedules
- Grace periods
- Emergency rotation procedures
- Rotation monitoring

### 4. Key Backup
- Secure backup procedures
- Recovery processes
- Backup encryption
- Access controls

## Integration with Workload Identity

### 1. SPIFFE/SPIRE Integration
- SPIFFE ID generation
- SPIRE server configuration
- Workload attestation
- Certificate issuance

### 2. Service Mesh Integration
