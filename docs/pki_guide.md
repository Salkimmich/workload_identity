## Basic PKI Concepts

### What is PKI?
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that manages digital certificates and public key encryption. It enables secure communication and identity verification in distributed systems.

### Core Components

1. **Digital Certificates**
   - Electronic documents that bind public keys to identities
   - Contain information about the certificate holder
   - Signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)

2. **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**
   - Trusted entities that issue and verify certificates
   - Maintain certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
   - Establish trust chains

3. **Public/Private Key Pairs**
   - Public keys: Shared publicly for encryption and verification
   - Private keys: Kept secure for decryption and signing
   - Used for:
     - Secure communication (encryption)
     - Digital signatures
     - Identity verification

4. **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)**
   - Lists of revoked certificates
   - Used to check certificate validity

5. **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**
   - Protocol for checking certificate status
   - Used to verify certificate validity

### Trust Model
PKI relies on trust anchors (usually root CAs) from which all certificate trust is derived. Intermediate CAs issue certificates down the chain, and verifying an identity means chaining up to a trusted root. This chain of trust is fundamental to establishing secure communication between workloads.

### Common Use Cases
- Secure communication (TLS/SSL)
- Digital signatures
- Code signing
- Email encryption
- Identity verification

## Certificate Lifecycle Management

### 1. Certificate Issuance
- Certificate signing requests (CSRs) must include proper identifiers (CN, SANs)
- Identity proofing required before CA signing
- Automated issuance for workloads using orchestrators or ACME protocol
- Correct trust domain designation for multi-cluster/multi-cloud scenarios

### 2. Certificate Validation
- Chain of trust verification to trusted root
- Trust anchor validation in trust store
- Revocation checking via CRL and OCSP
- Regular trust store updates for federation scenarios

### 3. Certificate Renewal
- Automated renewal for short-lived certificates
- Graceful rotation with overlapping certificates
- Integration with key rotation best practices
- Tooling support (cert-manager, SPIRE)

### 4. Certificate Revocation
- Multiple revocation methods:
  - CRL and OCSP
  - Instant revocation via identity push
  - Trust bundle updates
- Emergency procedures for compromised trust anchors
- Short-lived certificates as mitigation strategy

## Key Management Best Practices

### 1. Key Generation
- Use hardware RNGs or trusted entropy sources
- Avoid weak algorithms (RSA 1024, SHA1)
- Implement algorithm agility
- Follow FIPS standards where required

### 2. Key Storage
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)
- Secure Enclaves
- Cloud KMS services
- Secrets Management Integration:
  - Secure vault storage
  - Runtime key retrieval
  - Access control and audit logging

### 3. Key Rotation
- Regular rotation of leaf keys
- Planned CA key rotation
- Short key lifetimes for workloads
- Attestation checks during rotation
- Continuous testing of rotation procedures

### 4. Key Backup
- Encrypted and access-controlled backups
- HSM escrow or secure offline storage
- No plaintext key backups
- Secure destruction of old backups
