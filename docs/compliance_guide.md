## Compliance Overview

The workload identity system is designed to help organizations meet various regulatory and industry compliance requirements through its implementation of Zero Trust Architecture and robust security controls. This guide maps how the system addresses these requirements and provides guidance on using the system to maintain compliance.

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)
```yaml
zero_trust:
  principles:
    - "Verify explicitly"
    - "Use least privilege"
    - "Assume breach"
  implementation:

      - "Unique workload identities"
      - "Short-lived credentials"
      - "Continuous verification"
    policy_engine:
